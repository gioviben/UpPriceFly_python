# UpPriceFly

UpPriceFly aims to monitor flight prices and notify users of any changes. Since this application was designed to allow multiple users to monitor their flights of interest simultaneously, a system mechanism was chosen in which an Admin manages the users, and the users, once created, can independently add flights to monitor. The system operates based on the well-known messaging service: Telegram.

The java version is [UpPriceFly_java](https://github.com/gioviben/UpPriceFly_java).
